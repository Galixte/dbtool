## Requirements
* phpBB 3.1.0-RC2 or higher
* PHP 5.3.3 or higher
* MySQL 4.0.1 or higher (using MyISAM, InnoDB or Archive table types)

## Install
1. [Download the latest validated release](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/database_optimize_and_repair_tool/).
2. Unzip the downloaded release and copy it to the `ext` directory of your phpBB board.
3. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Manage extensions`.
4. Find `Database Optimize & Repair Tool` under Disabled Extensions and click `Enable`.

## Usage
After installation, you can find the Optimize & Repair Tool in:

`ACP -> Maintenance -> Database -> Optimize & Repair`.

> Use this extension at your own risk! There have been cases with certain shared web hosts where a database table could crash for a very large forum. This extension will perform the same functions on your database as phpMyAdmin, so if you have been using phpMyAdmin on your database with no problems, then it should be safe to use this extension. It is always safest to run a backup of your database before performing any Optimize or Repair functions just in case anything goes wrong.

> Note: InnoDB table types do not support the Repair option.

## Uninstall
1. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Manage extensions`.
2. Click the `Disable` link for Database Optimize & Repair Tool.
3. To permanently uninstall, click `Delete Data`, then delete the `dbtool` folder from `phpBB/ext/vse/`.
